 # ABOUT TASK PROJECT
 This Python-based text summarization program leverages Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a powerful library for natural language processing. It demonstrates a simple yet effective extractive summarization approach. Extractive summarization involves selecting the most important sentences from the original text based on certain criteria, rather than generating new sentences as in abstractive summarization.The code begins by importing necessary modules from the nltk package, including tokenizers, stemmers, stopwords, and frequency distribution utilities.
 The provided sample text is split into individual sentences using sent_tokenize(). This helps in scoring each sentence independently later on.
 The code extracts the ten most frequent stemmed words from the frequency distribution. These words are assumed to be the most significant in conveying the meaning of the text.
